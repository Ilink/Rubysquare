Rubysquare
==========
Cloud-esque music player. I didn't want to be tied down to a specific cloud music vendor (like Amazon or Google) so I started this project. While still in its infancy, skeletal functionality is coming along nicely.

Features Currently Under Development
--------------
*	Plays music, either through HTML5 or Flash (based on [Soundmanager2](https://github.com/scottschiller/SoundManager2))
*	Importing iTunes libraries (XML parsing powered by the incredible [Nokogiri](https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri))
*	Playlist creation and management
*	Hopefully an awesome UI
*	Album artwork

Future Features
--------------
*	Podcast management
*	Audiobook support
*	Improved integration with iTunes (it's a one-way street right now)

Usage
--------------
Most features are currently under heavy development. If this doesn't stop you, you're going to need Ruby on Rails 3.1, along with all the gems specified in the Gemfile.
