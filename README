Hello!

One day, when this is actually finished, it will be a cloud music player. I designed it for myself so I could listen to my music on any computer. This also avoids having to go through some other providers cloud service. 

This project is a work-in-progress. Nothing really works at the moment and there isn't a whole lot of functionality. In an attempt to learn Rails, I am porting this app from PHP.
